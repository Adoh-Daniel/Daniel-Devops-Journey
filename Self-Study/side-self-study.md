## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (SDLC)

**The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a framework that describes the various stages involved in the development of software. It provides a structured approach to software development, ensuring that software is developed efficiently, with high quality, and meets the needs of users and stakeholders. Here are the typical phases of the SDLC:

1. Planning
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintainance

These phases are typically sequential and iterative, meaning that they may be revisited or repeated as needed throughout the development process. Additionally, various methodologies, such as Waterfall, Agile, and DevOps, offer different approaches to organizing and executing these phases based on the specific needs of the project and organization. The choice of methodology depends on factors such as project size, complexity, team structure, and organizational culture.

## LAMP STACK
**LAMP** stands for **Linux** (Operating System), **Apache** (Server web), **MySQl** (Database Management), **Python, PHP** (Server-side Scripting Language), which is composed of a bunch of free and open-source software that represents an alternative to expensive commercial packages.

## Chmod and Chown

**chmod**
1. **chmod** changes the permissions of files and directories in Linux, controlling who can read, write, and execute them.
2. You can use symbolic or numeric representations to add, remove, or set permissions for the owner, group, and others.
3. It helps manage access to files and ensures security by controlling who can perform certain actions on them.

**chown**

1. **chown** changes the owner and group of files and directories in Linux, specifying who has control over them.
2. You can specify the new owner and group using the username or numeric user ID and group ID.
3. It helps manage ownership and ensures that the right users have appropriate control over files and directories.

# TCP and UDP

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**
1. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol used for reliable and ordered data transmission over networks.
2. It ensures that data packets arrive at their destination in the correct order and without errors by establishing a connection between sender and receiver.
3. TCP is commonly used for applications that require high reliability, such as web browsing, email, file transfer, and remote access.

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**
1. UDP is a connectionless protocol used for fast and efficient data transmission over networks.
2. It does not establish a connection before sending data and does not guarantee delivery or order of packets.
3. UDP is commonly used for real-time applications where speed is prioritized over reliability, such as streaming media, online gaming, DNS, and VoIP.

# Commonly Used Ports in Web Services:
**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):**
- Default Port: 80 (TCP)
- Used for transferring hypertext documents on the World Wide Web.

**HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):**
- Default Port: 443 (TCP)
- Used for secure communication over a computer network, ensuring encrypted data transmission.

**SSH (Secure Shell):**
- Default Port: 22 (TCP)
- Used for secure remote login, command execution, and data communication between networked computers.

**Telnet:**
- Default Port: 23 (TCP)
- Used for remote terminal access and communication between client and server.

**FTP (File Transfer Protocol):**
- Default Port: 21 (TCP)
- Used for transferring files between a client and a server on a computer network.

**SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol):**
- Default Port: 22 (TCP)
- Used for secure file transfer over a network, combining SSH security with FTP capabilities.
